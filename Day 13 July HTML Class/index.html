        <p>
            Chizurum Okere-Olujie is a multi-talented individual gifted with different ablities ranging from cooking to singing to dancing and many more. I was the dining prefect in my school before I graduated. I studied in Bloombreed High School, the First Google Reference School In Nigeria. I was born and raised in Port Harcout but my state of origin is Abia State. I have undying love for video games and aspire to be a professional gamer when I grow up. I plan on furthering my education in Nile University of Nigeria in Abuja. I want to study software engineering and business management in the university. I hope I can be one of the leading software engineers in Nigeria and use technology to solve Nigeria's problem
